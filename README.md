Wheat rust is a devastating plant disease that affects many African crops, reducing yields and affecting the livelihoods of farmers and decreasing food security across the continent. The disease is difficult to monitor at a large scale, making it difficult to control and eradicate.

The objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning algorithm to correctly classify if a plant is healthy, has stem rust, or has leaf rust.

An accurate image recognition model that can detect wheat rust from any image will enable a crowd-sourced approach to monitoring African crops, through avenues such as social media and smartphone images. This challenge represents a potential breakthrough in our ability to monitor and control plant diseases like wheat rust that affect African livelihoods.
